# Important Notes

## Code Style

-   Follow the (Prettier)[https://prettier.io/] setup.
-   camelCase for file names. (`longFileName.js`)
-   No `index.js` or `index.jsx` files.
-   As always: **when in Rome, do as the Romans do.**

You can run `npm run lint` to make sure everything passes. However, it would be much more effective to get ESLint/Prettier integrated with your editor so that you get live feedback.

## Removal of YUI

The original client was implemented using Yahoo's user interface library [YUI2](http://yui.github.io/yui2/docs/yui_2.9.0/docs/) which has been [depreciated since 2011](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2011/04/13/announcing-yui-2-9-0/). Since April 2015 there has been an ongoing effort to eradicate the old (buggy) YUI code.
